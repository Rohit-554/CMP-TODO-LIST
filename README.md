# Todo List App

This is a Todo List application built using Kotlin Multiplatform and Compose Multiplatform. It allows you to manage your tasks and projects efficiently on both Android and iOS devices using a single codebase.

## Why I created this project

I started this project to learn and demonstrate the power of Kotlin Multiplatform and Compose Multiplatform. My goal was to build a functional app that looks and feels great on both mobile platforms without writing separate code for each. It serves as a playground for experimenting with shared UI, animations, and state management in a modern cross-platform environment.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform:** Runs smoothly on both Android and iOS.
- **Task Management:** Create, edit, and organize your daily tasks.
- **Projects:** Group your tasks into projects with specific goals.
- **Priorities:** Set priorities for your tasks to focus on what matters most.
- **Categories:** Organize tasks by categories like Daily Study or Work.
- **Dates:** Set start and end dates for your projects to keep track of deadlines.
- **Custom Animations:** Includes a custom animated bottom navigation bar for a better user experience.
- **Onboarding:** A welcoming onboarding screen to get you started.
- **Settings:** Customize your app experience.

## How to install

To run this project on your local machine, you will need Android Studio and Xcode (for iOS).

1. **Clone the repository**
   Download the code to your computer using git clone.

2. **Open in Android Studio**
   Open the project folder in Android Studio. Wait for Gradle to sync and download all the necessary libraries.
